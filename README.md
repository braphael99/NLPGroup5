# NLPGroup5

This is the repository for NLP Group 5's group project. During this project, we will compare the performance of several out-of-the-box solutions at HuggingFace on the task of quantitative question answering in English, as detailed in the first task on https://sites.google.com/view/numeval/tasks?authuser=0. In particular we are handling the third subtask, quantitative question answering, which uses a multiple-choice format between two choices given a question.
